      This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've tried, but for
      super tender ribs, give it a try! Lean, country-style pork ribs are boiled
      in seasoned water until tender, then finished up in the oven under a
      blanket of your favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Â½ pounds country-style pork ribs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup barbeque sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Place ribs in a large pot and cover with water. Stir in kosher salt,
      garlic powder, and pepper, and bring water to a boil over medium heat.
      Continue to boil until ribs are tender, 40 to 45 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      While the ribs are boiling, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees
      C).
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Remove ribs from the pot, and place them in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour
      barbeque sauce over ribs. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven until the internal temperature of the pork has
      reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
